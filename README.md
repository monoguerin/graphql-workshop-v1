# GraphQL Workshop V1
First workshop about GraphQl

This will be a hands on workshop, with few exercises, no prior knowledge needed, the topics that we are going to talk about are:

* What is GraphQl?
* How to write a Query? Aliases, Naming
* How to write a Mutation? Variables
* Fragments
* Directives

## Running the exercises

You can run this code in a `codesandbox` by forking it with your own github account, or you can clone this repo and run it locally

All the Exercises are located in the `/exercises` folder, each of them has a matching unit test that you can run, passing the test will be a sign that the exercise is correct

### Example for exercise 1:

* Run the local server using the command:

    ```
      npm start
    ```

* Play around with GraphiQL that will be available in http://localhost:8080/

* Check the file `/exercises/exercise-1.graphql` for instructions, and write the solution in that file, use GraphiQL to test the syntax

* Test your solution using the command:

    ```
      npm run exercise-1
    ```

* If all the tests passed it means you did it correctly! ðŸŽ‰
